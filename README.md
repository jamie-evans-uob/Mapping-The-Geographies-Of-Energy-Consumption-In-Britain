# Mapping-The-Geographies-Of-Energy-Consumption-In-Britain

This repository provides a reproducible and replicable code for the project “Mapping The Geographies of Energy Consumption in Britain”. The project aims to map energy consumption across neigbourhoods in Britain using new data from domestic meters and Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). This ensures taht geography is central to the design of policies to achieve an equitable transition to Net Zero.
